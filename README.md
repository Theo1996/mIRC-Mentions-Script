# mIRC-Mentions-Script
**Instructions:**

**1.**Add to remote.ini

**2.**change the extra nick variation check in the if conditional.Otherwise it will work for anyone saying "theo" too.

This script notifies if your nick / name was mentioned in any channel.

It flashes, beeps and creates a new window @mentions where it writes all the details. Only the window @mentions existing notifies you that there were mentions since the flash and beeps dont last for long.

Close the window, if you want, to "mark" all mentions as read.

You can add more variations of your nickname to if, if for example people refer to you as jake instead of JakeCringe69
